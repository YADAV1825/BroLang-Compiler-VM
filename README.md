# BroLang-Compiler-VM
I built my own compiler, that compiles programs written in my own language (BroLang), into bytecode that runs on my own virtual CPU, which executes using my own virtual machine â€” all from scratch in C++.  No libraries. No frameworks. Just raw logic, control, and architecture.
